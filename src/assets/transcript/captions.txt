Wong: Hi, I'm Stephanie Wong, and I work for Google Cloud.
0:10
While I could talk all day about cloud security,
0:13
physical security at a Google data center
0:15
is still pretty new to me,
0:16
so today I'm on a mission to learn all about it
0:19
by taking an inside look at the systems in place
0:22
that protect customer data
0:23
at a typical Google data center. Let's go.
0:25
[upbeat music]
Security Layers
0:28
Now, I've been told there are six layers of security here.
0:31
Security layer one refers to the property boundaries,
0:34
and that includes signage and fencing.
0:37
But things really start to get interesting
0:38
when it comes to layer two, also known as the secure perimeter,
0:42
and that includes the main entrance gate which I am pulling up to right now.
0:46
[upbeat music]
0:49
Hey, how's it going? person: Good morning.
0:51
[upbeat music]
Layer 2 Security
0:58
Wong: So layer two has a lot of security features
1:01
ranging from smart fencing to overlapping cameras
1:04
to 24/7 guard patrols and more.
1:07
I'm on my way to meet some experts
1:09
who are going to show me how it all works.
1:13
Hi, Joe.
1:13
Kava: Hi, Stephanie, how are you?
1:15
Wong: So I just passed the main gate and I saw guards and cameras,
1:18
but what are some things that I didn't see?
1:20
Kava: Yeah there's actually a lot of technology
1:22
and operations going on behind the scene.
1:24
So from the time that you're on site,
1:26
we know that you're here,
1:27
and we're able to do correlation analysis
1:30
of where you've been.
1:31
We have guards in vehicles, we have some guards on foot.
1:34
There's also the vehicle crash barrier.
1:37
That's designed to stop a fully loaded truck
1:39
from crashing through the front entrance.
1:42
Wong: Ricky, Tarik, can you tell me more about what's unique about the fencing?
1:45
Gordon: This particular fence is an anti-climb fence.
1:48
It's also equipped with fiber. The technology tells us
1:52
if someone's near the fence or touches the fence.
1:55
Billingsley: So we use thermal cameras and standard cameras.
1:57
So we're able to see video footage at night
2:00
just as clearly as we can during the day.
2:03
[light electronic music]
Layer 3 Security
2:07
Wong: Welcome to layer three, building access.
2:10
But just so you know, I am still nowhere near
2:12
the data center floor.
2:14
That's a few more layers deep. Let's head inside.
2:17
O'Brien: Stephanie. Wong: Hello.
2:18
O'Brien: So you've gotten through the gate, you've come in,
2:20
you've come in to our secure lobby.
2:21
You have your card, and we know that that's you,
2:24
but if someone happened to lose their card,
2:26
what we want to make sure is that it's actually Stephanie
2:29
who has shown up.
2:30
scanner: Please center your eye.
2:32
O'Brien: And with iris scan, we can authenticate
2:34
that it's actually you along with your ID.
2:37
Wong: Okay, I think it's good.
2:41
One thing that's a little hard to get used to
2:43
when you visit a data center is,
2:45
for secure areas, only one person
2:47
is allowed to badge through a door at a time.
2:51
[light electronic music]
Layer 4 Security
3:02
Layer four includes the security operations center,
3:05
or SOC, a hive of activity that is monitoring the data center
3:09
24/7, 365 days a year.
3:12
[light electronic music]
3:14
So it sounds like we've been keeping them very busy today.
3:17
Davis: Yes, yes you have.
3:19
So the doors, the cameras, the badge readers,
3:22
the iris scan-- everything is connected here.
3:24
This is the brains of the security system.
3:27
So if there's anything out of the ordinary happening,
3:30
they have to be able to pick that up.
3:32
[upbeat music]
Layer 5 Security
3:40
Wong: Interesting fact about layer five,
3:41
the data center floor:
3:43
less than 1% of Googlers ever get to set foot in here.
3:47
So right now, I'm feeling kinda special.
3:48
[upbeat music]
3:58
Kava: This is truly a as-needed only access area,
4:02
meaning that only the technicians
4:04
and engineers that have to be there
4:06
to maintain, upgrade, or repair the equipment
4:09
are ever allowed there.
4:12
Wong: And do Googlers or anyone have access to the data?
4:15
Kava: We have access to the devices, but the data at rest
4:18
is encrypted, and our customers can issue
4:21
and keep their own encryption keys,
4:23
and we do this because protecting the privacy
4:26
and the security of our users' data is our highest priority.
Layer 6 Security
4:31
Wong: The mysterious layer six, where disks
4:34
are erased and destroyed and the fewest number of people
4:37
are allowed to enter.
4:39
Drives that need to be retired from the data center floor
4:41
come into this room through a secure two-way locker system
4:45
which means that only technicians assigned to this room
4:48
can pull them from that locker to either erase
4:50
or destroy them.
4:52
Henley: All right, welcome to the crusher room.
4:54
Wong: Wow.
4:55
Henley: So at this point, we have scanned the hard drive,
4:57
and the software has told us that we need to destroy it.
5:00
Wong: Can we see it in action?
5:01
Henley: Back up. Wong: All right.
5:02
I'll stay back here. [both laugh]
5:05
[mechanical whirring]
5:07
That disk is definitely destroyed.
5:09
Henley: Yes it is.
5:11
[upbeat music]
5:15
Wong: If you didn't think these six layers of security
5:17
were enough, Google Cloud actually has
5:20
two security testing programs in place.
5:22
One hires companies to try to break in
5:24
to data center sites from the outside,
5:27
and the other tasks Googlers with trying to break
5:29
security protocols from the inside.
5:33
And getting out of a data center is arguably even harder
5:37
than getting in, as everybody has to go through full metal detection
5:41
each time they leave the data center floor.
5:43
[upbeat music]
5:46
person: Thank you, ma'am, for your cooperation.
5:47
Wong: Thank you.
5:49
Google Cloud supports compliance
5:51
with over 40 global standards, regulations, and certifications,
5:55
and the commitment to constantly test, optimize, and improve systems
5:59
makes it a leader in data center security.
6:02
Now, how do I get out of here?
